## Abstract

We introduce Voyager, the first LLM-powered embodied lifelong learning agent
in Minecraft that continuously explores the world, acquires diverse skills,
and makes novel discoveries without human intervention. Voyager consists of
three key components: 1) an automatic curriculum that maximizes exploration,
2) an ever-growing skill library of executable code for storing and retrieving
complex behaviors, and 3) a new iterative prompting mechanism that
incorporates environment feedback, execution errors, and self-verification for
program improvement. Voyager interacts with GPT-4 via blackbox queries, which
bypasses the need for model parameter fine-tuning. The skills developed by
Voyager are temporally extended, interpretable, and compositional, which
compounds the agent's abilities rapidly and alleviates catastrophic
forgetting. Empirically, Voyager shows strong in-context lifelong learning
capability and exhibits exceptional proficiency in playing Minecraft. It
obtains 3.3x more unique items, travels 2.3x longer distances, and unlocks key
tech tree milestones up to 15.3x faster than prior SOTA. Voyager is able to
utilize the learned skill library in a new Minecraft world to solve novel
tasks from scratch, while other techniques struggle to generalize.

Voyager discovers new Minecraft items and skills continually by self-driven
exploration, significantly outperforming the baselines.

## Introduction

Building generally capable embodied agents that continuously explore, plan,
and develop new skills in open-ended worlds is a grand challenge for the AI
community. Classical approaches employ reinforcement learning (RL) and
imitation learning that operate on primitive actions, which could be
challenging for systematic exploration, interpretability, and generalization.
Recent advances in large language model (LLM) based agents harness the world
knowledge encapsulated in pre-trained LLMs to generate consistent action plans
or executable policies. They are applied to embodied tasks like games and
robotics, as well as NLP tasks without embodiment. However, these agents are
not lifelong learners that can progressively acquire, update, accumulate, and
transfer knowledge over extended time spans.  
  
Let us consider Minecraft as an example. Unlike most other games studied in
AI, Minecraft does not impose a predefined end goal or a fixed storyline but
rather provides a unique playground with endless possibilities. An effective
lifelong learning agent should have similar capabilities as human players: (1)
**propose suitable tasks** based on its current skill level and world state,
e.g., learn to harvest sand and cactus before iron if it finds itself in a
desert rather than a forest; (2) **refine skills** based on environment
feedback and **commit mastered skills to memory** for future reuse in similar
situations (e.g. fighting zombies is similar to fighting spiders); (3)
**continually explore the world** and seek out new tasks in a self-driven
manner.

  

## Voyager Components

We introduce Voyager, the first _LLM-powered embodied lifelong learning agent_
to drive exploration, master a wide range of skills, and make new discoveries
continually without human intervention in Minecraft. Voyager is made possible
through three key modules: 1) an **automatic curriculum** that maximizes
exploration; 2) a **skill library** for storing and retrieving complex
behaviors; and 3) a new **iterative prompting mechanism** that generates
executable code for embodied control. We opt to use code as the action space
instead of low-level motor commands because programs can naturally represent
temporally extended and compositional actions, which are essential for many
long-horizon tasks in Minecraft. Voyager interacts with a blackbox LLM (GPT-4)
through prompting and in-context learning. Our approach bypasses the need for
model parameter access and explicit gradient-based training or finetuning.

  
  
  
![](assets/images/components.png) Voyager consists of three key components: an
automatic curriculum for open-ended exploration, a skill library for
increasingly complex behaviors, and an iterative prompting mechanism that uses
code as action space.  
  

### Automatic Curriculum

![](assets/images/curriculum.png)  

Automatic curriculum. The automatic curriculum takes into account the
exploration progress and the agent's state to maximize exploration. The
curriculum is generated by GPT-4 based on the overarching goal of "discovering
as many diverse things as possible". This approach can be perceived as an in-
context form of _novelty search_.

  
  

### Skill Library

![](assets/images/skill_library.png)  

Skill library. **Top: Adding a new skill.** Each skill is indexed by the
embedding of its description, which can be retrieved in similar situations in
the future. **Bottom: Skill retrieval.** When faced with a new task proposed
by the automatic curriculum, we perform querying to identify the top-5
relevant skills. Complex skills can be synthesized by composing simpler
programs, which compounds Voyager's capabilities rapidly over time and
alleviates catastrophic forgetting.

  
  

### Iterative Prompting Mechanism

![](assets/images/feedback.png)  

Left: Environment feedback. GPT-4 realizes it needs 2 more planks before
crafting sticks. Right: Execution error. GPT-4 realizes it should craft a
wooden axe instead of an acacia axe since there is no acacia axe in Minecraft.

  
  
![](assets/images/self_verification.png)  
Self-verification. By providing the agent's current state and the task to
GPT-4, we ask it to act as a critic and inform us whether the program achieves
the task. In addition, if the task fails, it provides a critique by suggesting
how to complete the task.

## Experiments

We systematically evaluate Voyager and baselines on their exploration
performance, tech tree mastery, map coverage, and zero-shot generalization
capability to novel tasks in a new world.

  
  

### Significantly Better Exploration

As shown in the first figure, Voyager's superiority is evident in its ability
to consistently make new strides, discovering 63 unique items within 160
prompting iterations, 3.3x many novel items compared to its counterparts. On
the other hand, AutoGPT lags considerably in discovering new items, while
ReAct and Reflexion struggle to make significant progress.  
  

### Tech Tree Mastery

![](assets/images/tech_tree.png)

Tech tree mastery. The Minecraft tech tree tests the agent's ability to craft
and use a hierarchy of tools. Progressing through this tree (wooden tool ->
stone tool -> iron tool -> diamond tool) requires the agent to master
systematic and compositional skills. In this table, fractions indicate the
number of successful trials out of three total runs. **Numbers are prompting
iterations averaged over three trials. The fewer the iterations, the more
efficient the method.** Compared with baselines, Voyager unlocks the wooden
level 15.3x faster (in terms of the prompting iterations), the stone level
8.5x faster, the iron level 6.4x faster, and Voyager is the only one to unlock
the diamond level of the tech tree

  
  

### Extensive Map Traversal

![](assets/images/map.png)  

Map coverage: Two bird's eye views of Minecraft maps. Voyager is able to
navigate distances 2.3x longer compared to baselines by traversing a variety
of terrains, while the baseline agents often find themselves confined to local
areas, which significantly hampers their capacity to discover new knowledge.

  
  

### Efficient Zero-Shot Generalization to Unseen Tasks

![](assets/images/zero_shot_table.png) ![](assets/images/zero_shot.png)  

Zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks. We clear the agent's inventory,
reset it to a newly instantiated world, and test it with unseen tasks. In the
table above, fractions indicate the number of successful trials out of three
total runs. **Numbers are prompting iterations averaged over three trials. The
fewer the iterations, the more efficient the method.** Voyager can
consistently solve all the tasks, while baselines cannot solve any task within
50 prompting iterations. What's interesting to note is that our skill library
constructed from lifelong learning not only enhances Voyager's performance but
also gives a boost to AutoGPT. This demonstrates that the skill library serves
as a versatile tool that can be readily employed by other methods, effectively
acting as a plug-and-play asset to enhance performance.

  
  

### Ablation Studies

![](assets/images/ablation.png)  

Ablation studies. GPT-3.5 means replacing GPT-4 with GPT-3.5 for code
generation. Voyager outperforms all the alternatives, demonstrating the
critical role of each component. In addition, GPT-4 significantly outperforms
GPT-3.5 in code generation.

## Conclusion

In this work, we introduce Voyager, the first LLM-powered embodied lifelong
learning agent, which leverages GPT-4 to explore the world continuously,
develop increasingly sophisticated skills, and make new discoveries
consistently without human intervention. Voyager exhibits superior performance
in discovering novel items, unlocking the Minecraft tech tree, traversing
diverse terrains, and applying its learned skill library to unseen tasks in a
newly instantiated world. Voyager serves as a starting point to develop
powerful generalist agents without tuning the model parameters.
